# TODO List for Step Counter App

- [x] Create index.html with form for age, weight, gender inputs, display areas for steps and calories, and start/stop button.
- [x] Create styles.css for basic styling of the app.
- [x] Create script.js to handle user inputs, request device motion permission, detect steps using accelerometer data, calculate calories using the formula, and update display in real-time.
- [x] Test the app by running a local HTTP server (note: accelerometer requires HTTPS in production, but for local testing, HTTP may work on some browsers; suggest using a tool like ngrok for HTTPS if needed).
- [x] Update TODO as each step is completed.
